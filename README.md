# Medabot Medarotch Medal Generator
- This app is designed to generate and display an `.stl` to print a Medarotch Madabot Medal with the desired number.
- Confirmed metal list comprised of real medals from various members, unless we know the exact name and stage then a 3d printed one will not be added.

# Troubleshooting Generated Medals
- I have 3 normal and 1 Advance Medarotches, each have had issues showing the correct medals perfectly every time with both real and printed medals. After a few attempts of opening and closing they will usually work fine.
